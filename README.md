**“Resentment, fear, jealousy, impatience, grief, desire...These and other things give rise to temptation. ”**

**“Once possessed, you will give in to temptation. You won't even object to crossing boundaries that should never be crossed. And what awaits you there...is the pleasure of living hell.”**
